# Problem Statement
Many people are interested in testing and improving their programming skills. In order to assist people like them, our team decided to create a website called ‘LinuxQ’.

# Design Process
For the design, we decided to go with a darker theme, as most websites and apps
use a dark theme now and it is more soothing to look at.

## Intended Audience
People who have a common interest to improve their programming skills. Which can be working adults, students, professionals, etc.

# API Info
API Source: https://quizapi.io/docs/1.0/overview

# General Features
A Navigation bar is provided to surf through pages like Home, leaderboard, and Report.

### Home page
The home page has a navigation bar and a start button along with a lottie animation. Pressing the start button launches a quiz with 10 questions.

### Quiz page
There are 10 questions on the Quiz page and the score is displayed at the top of the page. After the quiz is completed, the user is given a form to fill out with their name. The score and name will then be recorded and stored in a database, to be used in the leaderboard page.

### Leaderboard page
On this page, it will display the highest scores achieved by users, displaying their rank, name and score in a table. There is a limit of 10 on the table, and the data is retrieved from a database.

### Report page
The form on this page allows you to fill in the name, e-mail, and feedback of the website. By doing so, we can improve the website. It sends the user input to a database.
