# Problem Statement
Many people are interested in testing and improving their programming skills. In order to assist people like them, my teammate and I decided to create a website called ‘LinuxQ’. To keep users engaged, we used a fun theme for the website.

## Intended Audience
People who have a common interest to improve their programming skills. Which can be working adults, students, professionals, etc.

### Quiz page
There are 20 questions on the Quiz page and the score is displayed at the top of the page. After the quiz is completed, the user is given a form to fill out with their name. A leaderboard is then generated using the user's name.

### Leaderboard page
Here, the highest scores of users are displayed, as well as their names. The navigation bar is also available on this page. This page is powered by restDB database.

### Report page
The form on this page allows you to fill in the name, e-mail, and feedback of the website. By doing so, we can improve the website. It sends the user input to the rest DB account.
